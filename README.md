# PointFormer
This is the code deployment of PointFormer accepted in ACCV2022 and DuPMAM  which is under review at IEEE Transaction on Multimedia.

## Deployment
The experiments were deployed on RTX3090 and python 3.6.13.

The code was released with pre-trained models and training logs, achieving 93.9% classification performance on the ModelNet40 dataset. If you obtain inconsistent results from training, multiple runs are recommended.

Pre-trained models and training logs for part segmentation will be released later.
